# Kubernetes workshop

This workshop is going to show and explain the the most *idiomatic* way to deploy application to Kubernetes cluster by using manifest yaml files.

We will deploy basic Single Page Application written in [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) and Rest API written with [Strapi](https://strapi.io/).
In the end of this workshop we will also discuss, how to make it more streamlined as you will see that this manifest file approach will not scale that well.
